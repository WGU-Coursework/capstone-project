# capstone-project

## Background

The Cloud Computing Capstone offers learners opportunities to demonstrate the culmination of their skills learned within the Cloud Computing program. In this course, learners will show their skills by defining system components and creating implementation plans for cloud solutions. The course also offers learners ways to demonstrate their skills in determining configurations for API, performing system administration tasks, and creating test plans for cloud solutions.

## Description

This project consists of three tasks.

## References

Please provide the full reference list entry for any outside sources used in this project.  Any information you use from an outside source (whether directly quoted, paraphrased, or summarized) should have both an in-text citation at the end of the sentence where you quoted, paraphrased, or summarized, and a reference list entry in this section. A reference list entry should include the following 4 items in this order:
    1. Author (or organization as author if no person)
    2. Date (or n.d. if no date)
    3. The title of the article, book, or website
    4. The publication information (if a website, the direct URL link; if a book, the publisher name and city; if a journal article, the name of journal, volume, issue and page numbers and/or the doi link)

## Task One

Propose a topic that aligns with your degree emphasis.

- Organize ideas for your capstone project so that you can create your project more efficiently.
- Discuss your ideas for the project with an instructor via email, phone, or text.

### Task One: Requirements

- Clearly explain your capstone topic.
  - This includes explaining the project scope, proposed technological solution, and timeline.
- Identify each of the following areas with the intent of creating a complete and realistic overview of your project.
  - Project topic AND description
  - Project purpose AND goals
  - Projected outcomes and deliverables
  - IMPLEMENTATION and EVALUATION
    - Describe how you will approach the implementation of your project

## Task Two

- Propose a cloud-computing solution for a business.
- Compile the information for your cloud-computing solution into a report based on the prompts in the following `Requirements` section. 
- This report is meant to help you in the next task (task three) to develop a plan for implementing your cloud-computing solution.

### Task Two: Requirements

- Describe the business problem or opportunity under investigation, including 2–3 drivers.
- Summarize the proposed cloud-computing solution, including the evaluation framework that will be used to determine how the success of the project will be assessed.
  - Explain how the proposed cloud-computing solution meets the security needs of the organization in the context of the business problem or opportunity.
- Explain the needs of 2–5 project stakeholder groups, including the impact of the cloud-computing solution on each project stakeholder group.
- Compare the proposed cloud-computing solution with two alternative solutions.
- Discuss the likelihood and impact of two threats or vulnerabilities related to the proposed cloud-computing solution and the cloud resources or services affected.
- Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
- Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## Task Two: Rubric

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

- The submission accurately describes the business problem or opportunity under investigation, including 2–3 drivers of the problem or opportunity.
- The submission logically summarizes the proposed cloud-computing solution and includes a logical evaluation framework that can be used to determine how the success of the project will be assessed.
- The submission logically explains how the proposed cloud-computing solution meets the security needs of the organization in the context of the business problem or opportunity.
- The submission logically explains 2–5 project stakeholder groups and logically explains the needs of each group, including the impact of the cloud-computing solution on each identified project stakeholder group.
- The submission accurately compares the proposed cloud-computing solution with 2 alternative solutions.
- The submission logically discusses the likelihood and impact of 2 threats or vulnerabilities related to the proposed cloud-computing solution and the cloud resources or services affected.
- The submission includes in-text citations for sources that are properly quoted, paraphrased, or summarized and a reference list that accurately identifies the author, date, title, and source location as available.
- This submission includes satisfactory use of grammar, sentence fluency, contextual spelling, and punctuation, which promote accurate interpretation and understanding.

## Task Three

In the previous tasks, you identified a business problem or opportunity in an organization and proposed a cloud-computing solution to address the problem or opportunity. In this task, you will further expand on the cloud-computing solution you proposed by developing an implementation plan for your cloud-computing solution.

### Task Three: Requirements

- Summarize the business problem or opportunity for the proposed cloud-computing solution.
- Explain how two services included in the proposed cloud-computing solution interact to solve the business problem.
- Describe how the proposed cloud-computing solution addresses security and disaster recovery considerations.
- Describe the costs associated with the proposed cloud-computing solution, including how the costs of the proposed cloud-computing solution were estimated.
- Explain how a standard methodology (e.g., agile, waterfall) will be applied to project implementation, including project phases or milestones.
- Describe how the proposed cloud-computing solution will be tested, including the test cases, scenarios, and acceptance criteria that will be used.
- Summarize a post-implementation plan that supports the proposed cloud-computing solution.
- Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
- Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
